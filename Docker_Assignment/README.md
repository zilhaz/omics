# Building a Dockerfile -- Assignment Instructions:

Your goal for this assignment is to build a working docker image.

1. For this file you will work from the `docker/Dockerfile`. Do not change the name or location of this file.
2. Create a new branch to work from for this assignment.
3. Add to this file so it uses a base image and installs your desired packages.
4. You can develop this locally/on your own computer or on github.com/here.
5. When you are ready to test the Dockerfile build, open a pull request with the branch you created.
6. You will see a test called `Docker Assignment Eval` begin running on this branch.
7. This evaluation test, a GitHub Action (GHA), will comment on your open PR whether your docker image builds successfully or not.
8. Keep working on your Docker image using the troubleshooting strategies we discussed in the Containers for Scientists course.
9. Should your image build successfully, you will be given a validation code.
10. Copy this code and paste it in your Coursera Graded Assignment.
11. Submit your quiz! If you got a real code it should work and you will get credit for this work!
