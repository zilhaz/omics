            Great job! Your GitHub Action ran successfully.

            Please copy the following secret code and provide it to your Coursera course to prove completion:

            ```

            ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Recent Workflow Runs Found** ‚ö†Ô∏è

            Your workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/GitHub_Action_Assignment.yml`, but I haven't found any successful runs in the last 7 days.

            **This could mean:**
            1. Your workflow hasn't been triggered yet
            2. Your workflow doesn't have the right triggers to run automatically
            3. Your workflow has errors that prevent it from running

            **To get your workflow running:**
            1. Make sure your workflow has triggers like:
               ```yaml
               on:
                 push:
                   branches: [ main ]
                 pull_request:
                   branches: [ main ]
               ```
            2. Try making a small change to your repository (like editing this comment or adding a space to a file) to trigger the workflow
            3. Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see if there are any workflow runs

            Once your workflow runs successfully, I'll automatically detect it and give you the completion code! üöÄ

            ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workflow Run Failed** ‚ö†Ô∏è

            Your workflow file exists and is valid, but the most recent run failed with status: `${{ needs.check-workflow.outputs.workflow_status }}`

            **Next steps:**
            1. Check the Actions tab in your repository to see the detailed logs
            2. Look for error messages in the failed workflow run
            3. Fix any issues in your workflow or the code it's trying to run
            4. Push your changes to trigger another run

            Once your workflow runs successfully, the evaluation will automatically update!

            Keep trying! You'll get it! üí™
