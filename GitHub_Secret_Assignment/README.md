# GitHub Secret -- Assignment Instructions:

Your goal for this assignment is to generate and store a GitHub secret.

1. Follow the steps it takes to create a personal access token and store it here. Store it as `ASSIGNMENT_SECRET`. It must be named exactly this or the eval will not find it to give you credit.
2. When you are ready to evaluate your work go to `Actions` and dispatch the `GitHub Secret Evaluation` action in this repo.
3. This evaluation test, a GitHub Action (GHA), will comment on a GitHub issue (go to the `Issues` tab) on whether you successfully completed this assignment or not.
6. Should your secret be successfully found you will be given a validation code on the issue.
7. Copy this code and paste it in your Coursera Graded Assignment.
8. Submit your quiz! If you got a real code it should work and you will get credit for this work!
